# Introduction
This is a set of reproducible examples for the R[@R] `Hmisc` package[@Hmisc], put together in an `rmarkdown` notebook using `RStudio` and `knitr`.  When viewing the resulting [html file](http://data.vanderbilt.edu/fh/R/Hmisc/examples.nb.html) you can see all the code, and can download the entire `rmarkdown` script, which is especially helpful for seeing how `knitr` chunks are specified.  Graphics that have a [plotly](http://plot.ly/r) method for them are rendered using `plotly` instead of using defaults such as base graphics, `lattice`, or `ggplot2`.  That way the plots are somewhat interactive, e.g., allow for drill-down for more information without the viewer needing to install `R`.

Much of the tabular output produced here was created using `html` methods, which are especially easy to implement with `rmarkdown` and make for output that can be directly opened using word processors.

# Setup
```{r setup,results='hide'}
require(Hmisc)
#knitrSet(lang='markdown') #, h=5.5, w=7)
options(grType='plotly') # for certain graphics functions
mu <- markupSpecs$html   # markupSpecs is in Hmisc
```
The following hidden command (<code>r mu$widescreen()</code>), causes the html notebook to use an entire wide screen.
`r mu$widescreen()`

# Fetching Data, Modifying Variables, and Printing Data Dictionary
The `getHdata` function is used to fetch a dataset from the Vanderbilt `DataSets` web site.  `upData` is used to

- create a new variable from an old one
- add labels to 2 variables
- add units to the new variable
- remove the old variable
- automatically move units of measurements from parenthetical expressions in labels to separate `units` attributed used by `Hmisc` and `rms` functions for table making and graphics

`contents` is used to print a data dictionary, run through an `html` method for nicer output. 
```{r metadata}
getHdata(pbc)
# Have upData move units from labels to separate attribute
pbc <- upData(pbc,
              fu.yrs = fu.days / 365.25,
              labels = c(fu.yrs = 'Follow-up Time',
                         status = 'Death or Liver Transplantation'),
              units = c(fu.yrs = 'year'),
              drop  = 'fu.days',
              moveUnits=TRUE, html=TRUE)
html(contents(pbc), maxlevels=10, levelType='table')
```
# Descriptive Statistics Without Stratification
The html method is used for the `describe` function, and the output is put in a scrollable box.  Other than for the overall title and variable names and labels, the output size used here is 80 (0.8 &times; the usual font size[^1]).  But the graphical display of the descriptives statistics that follows this is probably better.

[^1]: The default is 75% size.

```{r describe}
d <- describe(pbc)
html(d, size=80, scroll=TRUE)
plot(d)
```

# Stratified Descriptive Statistics
Produce stratified quantiles, means/SD, and proportions by treatment group.  Plot the results before rendering as an advanced html table:

- categorical variables: a single dot chart
- continuous variables: a series of extended box plots

```{r summaryM}
s <- summaryM(bili + albumin + stage + protime + sex + age + spiders +
              alk.phos + sgot + chol ~ drug, data=pbc,
							overall=FALSE, test=TRUE)
plot(s, which='categorical')
```
```{r summaryM2}
plot(s, which='continuous', vars=1 : 4)
plot(s, which='continuous', vars=5 : 7)
```

```{r summaryM3}
html(s, caption='Baseline characteristics by randomized treatment',
     exclude1=TRUE, npct='both', digits=3,
     prmsd=TRUE, brmsd=TRUE, msdsize=mu$smaller2)
```

# Computing Environment[^2]
`r mu$session()`

# Bibliographic File Managament
## Find and Install `.csl` Reference Style Files
```{r findbib,eval=FALSE}
# Note: mu was defined in an earlier code chunk
# Only need to install .csl file once.
mu$installcsl(rec=TRUE)   # get list of recommended styles
mu$installcsl()     # web search of styles meeting your criteria
# Install a .csl file to your project directory:
mu$installcsl('american-medical-association')
```
## Manage `citeulike` Bibliographic Databases
In the following code chunk, adding `cache=TRUE` to the chunk header would result in the code (including the file download) not having to be run each time the report is run.  `eval=FALSE` is set in the code chunk so the code actually isn't run.
```{r citeulike,eval=FALSE}
# Show full reference information for selected BibTeX keys on
# your citeulike database
cu <- mu$citeulikeShow
cu('harrelfe', c('cox58reg', 'cox72'))
# Automatically extract all BibTeX keys referenced in this document and
# show full reference information for them
# The function invisibly returns the vector of keys found
cu('harrelfe', file='examples.Rmd')
# Show and optionally export all articles with a given tag
cu('harrelfe', tags='missing-data')
# Copy and rename downloaded references to current project directory
file.copy('~/Downloads/harrelfe-missing-data.bib', 'missing-data.bib',
          overwrite=TRUE)
```

[^2]: `mu` is a copy of the part of the `Hmisc` package object `markupSpecs` that is for html.  It includes a function `session` that renders the session environment (including package versions) in html.
